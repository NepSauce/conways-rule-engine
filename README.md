# Conway's Rule Engine

**Small rules. Big consequences.**

## Overview

Conway's Rule Engine is a flexible and extensible framework for simulating rule-based systems and environments. It is designed to allow users to define, modify, and experiment with custom rulesets and environments, making it suitable for a wide range of applications such as cellular automata, simulations, and more.

## Features

- Modular architecture for easy extension and customization
- Rule-driven logic for defining system behavior
- Configurable environments and parameters
- Designed for clarity, flexibility, and experimentation

## Project Structure

- `conways_game/`: Example implementation and core modules for rule-based environments
- `custom_engine/`: Space for user-defined or extended engines
- `util/`: Utility modules
- `rules_config_json`: Configuration file for rules and environment parameters

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Python 3.x.
3. (Optional) Install any additional dependencies as needed.
4. Configure your rules and environment in the provided configuration file.
5. Run the engine or your custom implementation.
